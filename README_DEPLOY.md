# Valentine OS (Level 3) — Simple + Huge + Zero Build Tools

This is a BIG interactive Valentine project built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

No Vite, no React, no npm required for hosting. It works on GitHub Pages as-is.

## Your passcode
Hint: our dramatic desi line 😌
Passcode: aajamerijaan

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages (easy)
1. Upload ALL files in this folder to your GitHub repo (main branch).
2. GitHub → Repo Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from a branch
4. Branch: main / (root)

Then your site will be:
https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOURREPO/

## Add your photos/videos (this is what makes it hit)
Put your real files into:
- media/photos/
- media/chats/
- media/videos/
- media/audio/   (optional)

Then edit `data.js`:
- Replace the scrapbook items' `src` with your real filenames.
  Example: `media/photos/us_01.jpg`

## Notes
- Avoid uploading copyrighted music. If you have your own audio (voice note, piano cover), put it in `media/audio/track1.mp3`.
- All paths are relative, so it works in GitHub Pages subfolders automatically.
